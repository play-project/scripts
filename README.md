Play scripts
============

Some (useful) scripts to manage the platform

# Configuration

You need to set the following environment variables used by the bin/* scripts:

- PLAY_STABLE : Where the stable platform is installed
- PLAY_PUBSUB : The pubsub bootstrap endpoint (deprecated...)

# TODO
- Installation scripts (ruby like in https://github.com/play-project/play-dsb-config/blob/master/stable/update.rb)
